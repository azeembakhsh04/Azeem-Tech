## 1. Information We Collect
We collect limited information necessary to provide and improve our services. During email or Google login, we collect **user ID, name, email address, and profile photo URL**. 

When a user shares a WhatsApp group, we collect the **group link, group name, and group profile image** if publicly available. 

> **Important:** We do not collect private messages, contacts, or phone numbers.

## 2. Why We Use Google / Email Login
We use Google or email-based login to:
* Securely store user data under a unique login ID.
* Prevent fake or duplicate accounts.
* Allow users to recover their data if they reinstall the app or change their device.
* Link shared WhatsApp groups to real user accounts for accountability.

**Note:** We do not access email inboxes, contacts, or private content.

## 3. WhatsApp Group Review and Publishing
When a user submits a WhatsApp group, it is first placed in **pending status**. Our team reviews and classifies the group into the appropriate category. After approval, the group is published and made visible to other users. 

*We reserve the right to reject or remove any group that violates our policies or applicable laws.*

Users are responsible for ensuring that the WhatsApp groups they share are legal and do not violate third-party rights. Offensive, illegal, or misleading content is strictly prohibited.
